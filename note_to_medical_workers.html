<p><br>
This will likely not end in a month or even a few months. Unfortunately the nature of pandemics is that
outbreaks often come in waves and there is little reason to believe that this will be any different.
While there are lives currently at stake, we are unfortunately forced to look through a macro lens in many regards. </p>

<p>We are in this for the long haul, burning yourself out now will not help you or your
future patients. As the unsustainable demand for care continues to increase, we are
bound to face increasingly difficult ethical dilemmas. Nurses and doctors often make
the worst patients but your health has never been more important than it is now.
Medical supplies and ventilators are important in quelling this pandemic but only
if those who know how to use them are there to do so. </p>

<p>For the good of your patients and those to come, take care of yourselves and advocate
for your own sake that and of your colleagues. Your well-being is and will continue
to be more important than a job in a time where demand for health workers has never been higher. </p>

<p>God bless you all and may He guide you through these dark times.</p>
